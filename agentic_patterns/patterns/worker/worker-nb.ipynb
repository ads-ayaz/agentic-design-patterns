    "# WORKER | Agentic Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Worker** is a single-agent pattern in which a task is assigned to a capable agent (the Worker), who interprets the task and completes it to the best of its ability. The result is returned directly without any internal validation loop or coordination with other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Addressed\n",
    "This pattern is ideal for tasks that are self-contained, well-scoped, and do not require iterative refinement, delegation, or oversight. It simplifies agent orchestration by relying on a single, well-configured agent to interpret and execute the task autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents |**\n",
    "- `Worker`: Responsible for interpreting and executing the task, and returning the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coordination Topology |**\n",
    "- Single-agent execution. Input is passed to the Worker; output is returned to the caller. No feedback or retries are built into the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Worker agent:\n",
    "  - Possesses the appropriate **tools** or **capabilities** to complete the task.\n",
    "  - Is capable of **interpreting the input**, **executing actions**, and **generating a coherent result**.\n",
    "  - May or may not use memory (STM or LTM), depending on task requirements.\n",
    "- There is no expectation of **external validation**, **collaboration**, or **multi-step refinement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inputs\n",
    "- A task description, instruction, or goal (typically natural language or structured prompt).\n",
    "- Optional: Memory, which gives the Worker the ability to retain a  history of past work as context for future tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- A final result, as produced by the Worker.\n",
    "- May optionally include a self-assessed confidence score, rationale, or explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavioural Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input task is provided to the Worker.\n",
    "2. Worker interprets the task and determines an appropriate course of action.\n",
    "3. Worker executes the task using internal reasoning and available tools.\n",
    "4. Worker returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths\n",
    "- Simple to implement and operationalize.\n",
    "- Low latency and cost.\n",
    "- Suitable for tasks with low ambiguity or limited risk from error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weaknesses\n",
    "- No built-in feedback, validation, or improvement loop.\n",
    "- Prone to hallucination or misinterpretation on complex or ambiguous inputs.\n",
    "- No accountability or explanation beyond what the Worker may optionally provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variations and Extensions\n",
    "- **Reflective Worker**: Adds an internal self-critique step before returning.\n",
    "- **Memory-Augmented Worker**: Leverages LTM for more consistent outputs across tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Use Cases\n",
    "- Generate a product description from specifications.\n",
    "- Answer a factual question using embedded knowledge.\n",
    "- Write a function to perform a specific operation.\n",
    "\n",
